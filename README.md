# mcds
mcds is a bash script which modifies the server properties files with any
changes specified as command arguments, and then runs the server in the same
terminal window as mcds was executed in. This allows for very speedy swapping
between different worlds, gamemodes, and a heap of other restrictions and
settings found in server.properties. It may also be useful in the automation of
specific configuration presets (although the same can be achieved by simply
swapping out the server.properties file, but who knows, you might want to use
this script to generate it in the first place or just alter minor things).
